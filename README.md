# A wannabe GPS, based on Spark Streaming


<i>Still working on this ... (different services to be used, with C++ code ... more algorithms)</i>

<i>This is supposed to be phun, to understand how things work under the hood.

You can find below details in the attached pdf - for all the minuses of the project, there is also a Real Case Scenario. 

i)   Preparing the environment (more containers, yey!)

ii)  Simulating Data (coordinates) - Python (yes, I am too lazy for using Google maps account)

iii) Data ingestion - Scala code 

iv) Creating map and exposing the vehicleâ€™s  location (SQL, PHP and Leaflet)

v)  Finding the nearest  restaurant, while knowing the position of the vehicle when the request was made - SQL and  PHP
